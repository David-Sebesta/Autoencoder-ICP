## Purpose
<purpose>
The goal of this project was to create a simple autoencoder using primary component analysis (PCA).
Then using the autoencoder, three sets of data would be encoded and decoded.
The data consists of the mnist 8x8 digits, mnist 28x28 digits, and a cropped version of the Yale Faces.
This autoencoder also allows for the data to be corrupted by noise and reconstructed.
</purpose>


## Technique
<technique>
An basic autoencoder consists of two parts: an encoder and decoder.
The encoder transforms the data to a smaller dimension based on the most important components.
Then the decoder transforms it back to the original dimensions.
